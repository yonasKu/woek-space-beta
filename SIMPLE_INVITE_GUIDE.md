## 🎯 Key Point

**You can ONLY invite people who already have accounts!**

If they don't have an account, they need to sign up first.

---

## ✅ This is Normal!

This is how most apps work:
- Slack: User must have Slack account
- GitHub: User must have GitHub account
- Discord: User must have Discord account

Same here: User must have an account first!

## 🚀 Quick Solution

**Tell the person you want to invite:**

"Hey, please sign up at http://localhost:3001/sign-up first, then I can invite you!"

After they sign up, you can invite them! ✅
